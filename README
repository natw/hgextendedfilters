HG Extended Filters
by Nat Williams

This is just a few nice filters for making writing mercurial templates or
style files less painful.


trailingspace
-------------

The trailingspace filter returns the item with the addition of a trailing
space, but only if the item is not empty.  This is useful for items like
{tags} that aren't necessarily meaningful for every changeset.


parens, squarebrackets, anglebrackets
-------------------------------------

These three filters return the item surrounded in their namesake bracket.
Like trailingspace, they all return an empty string if the item itself
is also empty.


colors
------

Rather than have to manually put horrible color codes into your templates,
just use these filters to colorize items.

Recognized color names are:
    black, red, green, brown, blue, purple, cyan, light_gray, dark_gray,
    light_red, light_green, yellow, light_blue, light_purple, light_cyan,
    white, and reset.
